# E-commerace app

## Tech stack

- Project initialised using CRA and written in React using hooks, Redux toolkit and RTK query for state management and api fetching. Tests are written using RTL, Jest and msw for mocking.

- Please note that I was not able to successfully fully test the components that utilitised RTK query. I would have liked to achieve 80%+ code coverage with the project.
